There should be a .pt file in this directory named "aerial_retinanet.pt"

NOTE: It seems like the last bunch of models are overfitted (Loss decreased but mAP remained the same).
      I'm guessing that the best model would be somewhere between #50 and #75.

      The models are located on Aryan's computer in the pytorch-retinanet/ submodule.
